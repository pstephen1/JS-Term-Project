    <!-- This page is designed to have a minimalistic feel to it, yet aesthetically pleasing with soft colors and rounded edges.-->
         
    <!--Using soft colors versus harsher, brighter ones makes the page easy on the eyes. The color theme utilizes various shades
         of lighter blue. Gamers appreciate off-whites and lighter colors versus harsh whites, which may strain
         the eyes after a relatively short period of time of intense screen-watching. I do plan on adding more graphics
        later in the project - The current color scheme is a placeholder, but should resemble the overall final aesthetic of the site. -->
